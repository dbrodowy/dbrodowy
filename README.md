Hi, my name is Darren Brodowy.  As of May 2022, I am a Bachelor of Science in Physics from San Francisco State University. 
I am starting my Master's in Astronomy/Astrophysics with an expected graduation date of May 2024.  I am new to GitHub, but plan
on getting more aquainted with it as I expand my skillset and portfolio with new projects.

Although I love gaining any knowledge pertaining to Astronomy & Physics, I have discovered that I am most interested in cosmology
and understanding the early stages of our universe.  I also enjoy learning how to solving problems related to astrophysics, such as 
orbital mechanics!
